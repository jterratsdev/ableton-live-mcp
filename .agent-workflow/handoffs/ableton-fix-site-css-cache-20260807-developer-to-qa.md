# Handoff ableton-fix-site-css-cache-20260807: developer to qa

## Task Context
- Title: Bust stale product stylesheet cache
- Goal: not specified
- Current owner: developer
- Current status: pending

## Acceptance Criteria
- The local stylesheet URL includes a deterministic content version while the shared token URL remains unchanged.
- The site contract resolves query-versioned local assets and passes.
- After push, live desktop and mobile screenshots render the new navigation, accent CTA, and shared typography without the stale details marker.

## Scope And Paths
- site/index.html
- scripts/check-site.mjs

## Phase Handoff
- Status: ready_for_review
- Changed components: Implementation against acceptance criteria Consumed context files: workflow task context and prior handoff. Changed files: no repository files changed by deterministic phase execution. Changed-file traceability: no repository files changed, so task path ownership remains unchanged. Simplicity review: deterministic phase used the smallest coherent workflow handoff and added no speculative abstractions or unrelated cleanup. Goal-to-verification map: recorded acceptance criteria require observable implementation artifacts and command assertions; verification is pending. Architectural concerns: inherited none; self-imposed none. Unit test evidence: deterministic phase generated no code-level delta. Commands run: no product validation command was executed. Handoff notes: parent implementation and evidence are required before QA handoff. AC1 verification pending: The local stylesheet URL includes a deterministic content version while the shared token URL remains unchanged. -> requires an observable artifact, executed command, and explicit assertion. AC2 verification pending: The site contract resolves query-versioned local assets and passes. -> requires an observable artifact, executed command, and explicit assertion. AC3 verification pending: After push, live desktop and mobile screenshots render the new navigation, accent CTA, and shared typography without the stale details marker. -> requires an observable artifact, executed command, and explicit assertion.
- Behavior changed: Implementation against acceptance criteria
- Unit tests: See phase task evidence
- Commands run: See phase task evidence
- Known gaps: All required transition checks were explicitly assessed.
- Risks:
- Recommended Playwright coverage: not applicable
- Executor provenance: mode=single-agent; executor=parent-agent; role=developer; phase=developer; runtime=codex-cli; fallback=workflow phase execution mode is single-agent; directProviderApiAllowed=false
