- Task id: ableton-session-scene-tempo-signature-20260820
- Runtime: Codex CLI (codex-cli)
- Phase: architect
- Role: architect
- Session id: ableton-session-scene-tempo-signature-20260820:wfrun-1787185194034-63cc7d:architect:codex-cli
- Status: requested
- Async mode: full-async
- Default parent wait: false
- Completion: lifecycle-event-or-explicit-poll
- Spawn bridge mode: parent-tool

## Parent Runtime Action
- Action kind: codex-spawn-agent
- Native tool: spawn_agent
- Runtime bridge guidance: Render a spawn request artifact that the parent Codex runtime can execute with its spawn_agent tool.
- Parent runtime should call spawn_agent with the assignment below.
- Orchestra only rendered this request and recorded provenance.
- Call spawn_agent from the active Codex parent runtime with the prompt artifact as the child assignment.
- Prefer background execution and avoid waiting unless the next parent step is blocked.
- Record spawned and terminal lifecycle states with the returned agent id.
- Spawn lifecycle: orchestra runtime spawn-lifecycle --session ableton-session-scene-tempo-signature-20260820:wfrun-1787185194034-63cc7d:architect:codex-cli --status spawned --agent-id <agent-id>
- Complete lifecycle: orchestra runtime spawn-lifecycle --session ableton-session-scene-tempo-signature-20260820:wfrun-1787185194034-63cc7d:architect:codex-cli --status completed --agent-id <agent-id> --artifact .agent-workflow/handoffs/ableton-session-scene-tempo-signature-20260820-wfrun-1787185194034-63cc7d-architect-architect-runtime-handoff.md

# Open Orchestra Runtime Bootstrap

Runtime target: Codex. Reference Open Orchestra from AGENTS.md so local CLI work follows workflow gates.

## Non-Negotiable Runtime Rules

These rules are non-negotiable. Follow them in every conversation and every work block:

- Use Orchestra for all project work: planning, implementation, fixes, reviews, QA, release, CI, research, and documentation.
- Do not edit files, run implementation work, or dispatch agents before a matching Orchestra task exists and a workflow run is active.
- Always run the runtime health preflight, inspect active tasks, and validate pre-run context before work.
- If a gate is paused, stop and wait for explicit user approval before continuing.
- Record real evidence: commands, files, outputs, logs, screenshots, traces, or explicit deferred-risk rationale.
- Never treat simulated handoffs, generated summaries, or workflow state alone as proof of completed QA.
- Never push, tag, publish, or deploy without explicit user instruction.

Use Open Orchestra as the local control plane when `.agent-workflow/` exists.
The active LLM runtime is the parent agent. Orchestra renders spawn requests and records lifecycle; it does not call provider APIs directly.

# Semantic Code

Code must be readable by intent before it is explained by comments.

## Naming

- Use domain language for modules, functions, variables, types, and test names.
- Prefer names that reveal purpose and observable behavior, such as `validateReleaseGateEvidence`, not vague names such as `processData`.
- Boolean names must make the predicate clear: `isReady`, `hasEvidence`, `canRetry`, `shouldBlockRelease`.

## Structure

- Keep entry points thin. Move decisions and business rules into focused domain, service, or policy modules.
- Extract helpers when a reader needs comments to understand a block of code.
- Avoid generic containers in public APIs when narrow types or explicit models can describe the contract.
- Avoid hardcoded command lists, statuses, roles, labels, or fixture values when a typed registry or catalog can be the source of truth.

## Comments

- Comments explain why, trade-offs, invariants, or external constraints.
- Do not add comments that restate what the code already says.
- If a function needs line-by-line comments to be understandable, refactor the names, types, or helper boundaries.

## Review Checklist

- A reviewer can identify the domain intent from names and file boundaries without tracing every line.
- New code follows the existing project vocabulary and layering.
- Tests read like behavior specifications and use meaningful scenario names.

# Architecture Decisions

Important architecture choices must be recorded briefly. The goal is traceability, not bureaucracy.

## When to Record an ADR
- Record an ADR when changing system boundaries, data ownership, integration contracts, authentication, authorization, infrastructure, deployment, or storage patterns.
- Record an ADR when choosing a new framework, library, cloud service, messaging pattern, database, or testing strategy.
- Record an ADR when a decision has meaningful trade-offs, migration cost, security impact, or rollback complexity.

## ADR Format
- Title: short decision name.
- Status: proposed, accepted, superseded, or rejected.
- Context: problem, constraints, and forces.
- Decision: chosen approach.
- Consequences: benefits, costs, risks, and follow-up work.
- Alternatives considered: at least one reasonable option and why it was not chosen.

## Decision Hygiene
- Keep ADRs concise and link them from PRs when relevant.
- Supersede old ADRs instead of rewriting history.
- If a decision is reversed, record why new information changed the outcome.
- Architecture decisions must align with security, testing, observability, and delivery quality gates.

# Module Boundaries

Every code change must preserve clear ownership boundaries. Before adding code
to an existing file, check whether the file is already large, multi-purpose, or
adapter-shaped. If the change would make the file harder to review, create or
reuse the correct domain, model, service, repository, or adapter module instead.

## Pre-Write Check

- Inspect the target file's current responsibility, exported surface, and size
  before editing.
- Treat files over 300 lines, functions over 30 lines, and command/controller
  files with business logic as god-file risk.
- A large existing file is not a reason to keep adding to it. If the new change
  is separable, extract the new behavior into a focused module and wire it from
  the existing entry point.
- If extraction is unsafe in the current task, record a follow-up debt task with
  the reason, affected file, and proposed boundary.

## Expected Layers

- `model` or `types`: narrow public data contracts, discriminated unions,
  schemas, and DTOs.
- `domain`: pure invariants, policy decisions, validation rules, state
  transitions, and calculations.
- `service` or `use-case`: orchestration of domain logic, repositories, clients,
  and side effects for one workflow.
- `repository`, `store`, or `gateway`: persistence, file I/O, network I/O, and
  external system adapters.
- `commands`: CLI adapter only. Parse arguments, call services, format output,
  and convert errors to user-safe messages.
- `web` or `api`: HTTP/UI adapter only. Parse requests, call services, serialize
  responses, and map errors.

## Logicless Commands

Command modules must remain nearly logicless. They may:

- parse flags and positional arguments;
- choose output format;
- call one service/use-case function;
- map expected errors to CLI messages and exit codes.

Command modules must not:

- own business rules or workflow policy;
- perform direct persistence when a repository/service should own it;
- contain repeated hardcoded registries, option lists, status sets, or provider
  matrices;
- implement complex loops, joins, retries, or batching;
- become the primary test target for domain behavior.

## Hardcoded Collections

Repeated hardcoded values must move to a typed source of truth. This applies to
roles, statuses, providers, commands, option lists, validators, selectors,
fixtures, CI matrices, and any key/value collection reused by more than one
consumer. Load `collection-standards` when this risk appears.

## Review Checklist

- Did the author check target file size and responsibility before writing?
- Did new logic land in the correct layer?
- Is the command/controller/route still a thin adapter?
- Are repeated hardcoded collections extracted to a typed source of truth?
- Is there a follow-up debt task when extraction was intentionally deferred?

# Development Engineering

Developer work must start from the existing project shape, preserve the local architecture, and leave verifiable evidence that the changed production artifact works.

## Project Context First
- Read the project manifest, build files, framework config, and existing module boundaries before generating code.
- Infer naming, layering, dependency direction, error style, logging style, and test conventions from nearby code.
- Do not introduce a new framework pattern, repository style, package layout, or dependency injection approach without a recorded architecture decision.
- Keep framework-specific adapters at the boundary. Domain and service code should remain portable where the product permits it.
- Before writing to an existing file, run a module-boundary check: current file size, responsibility, exported surface, and whether the new behavior belongs in domain, model, service, repository, or adapter code.
- Do not increase god-file risk. If a file is already large, multi-purpose, or adapter-shaped, prefer adding a focused module and wiring it from the existing entry point instead of adding more logic.

## Entry Points And Layers
- Controllers, routes, commands, triggers, handlers, jobs, and webhooks must stay thin.
- Delegate business rules to services or domain modules, and delegate I/O to repositories, clients, gateways, or data-access modules.
- Keep request parsing, authorization, validation, orchestration, and persistence r

- Keep framework-specific adapters at the boundary. Domain and service code should remain portable where the product permits it.
- Before writing to an existing file, run a module-boundary check: current file size, responsibility, exported surface, and whether the new behavior belongs in domain, model, service, repository, or adapter code.
- Do not increase god-file risk. If a file is already large, multi-purpose, or adapter-shaped, prefer adding a focused module and wiring it from the existing entry point instead of adding more logic.

## Entry Points And Layers
- Controllers, routes, commands, triggers, handlers, jobs, and webhooks must stay thin.
- Delegate business rules to services or domain modules, and delegate I/O to repositories, clients, gateways, or data-access modules.
- Keep request parsing, authorization, validation, orchestration, and persistence r

## Guardrails
- Execute only through the active parent runtime, not through direct vendor APIs.
- Do not include secrets, full transcripts, or unrelated workspace context in the child prompt.
- Respect ownership paths and active locks before editing.
- Return a concise handoff with touched files, test evidence, risks, and close status.
- Handoff must include `Consumed Context Files` with required files read, rules applied, and non-applicable required rules with reasons.
- Close or mark the delegated session failed if the parent tool cannot create a child agent.
- Guardrail status: allow
- Requested spawns: 1/3
- Active delegates: 0/3
- Delegation depth: 0/1
- Context budget: 3000/3000
- Spawn budget: 6000
- Timeout ms: 600000
- Stale claim TTL ms: 1800000
- Nested delegation allowed: false
- Handoff max chars: 4000
- Guardrail reasons: none

# Architect Playbook

- Define boundaries, data flow, integration contracts, and rollback risk.
- Check whether the task is technically oversized: too many modules, boundaries, integrations, data changes, runtime changes, UI changes, or release surfaces in one delivery unit.
- If complexity is too high, record a split recommendation with technical slices, dependency order, risk, and owner roles without blocking routine small tasks.
- Prefer existing project patterns before adding abstractions.
- Record sizing and ADR-level decisions when the design has lasting impact.
